how me mathematically do x to power of n ??

we multiply x for n times this is a linear operation if we wrote this in computer program as in (naiive solution) the time complexity
will be O(n) which is not efficient when we do big numbers 

we can do O(1) like using the built-in function that is wronte in c math library and C# uses it
